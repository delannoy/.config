alias scp='scp -p -r -v'
# -p                    Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original file
# -r                    Recursively copy entire directories. Note that scp follows symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal
# -v                    Verbose mode. Causes scp and ssh(1) to print debugging messages about their progress.  This is helpful in debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.

# --hsts-file=file      By default, Wget stores its HSTS database in ~/.wget-hsts. You can use --hsts-file to override this. Wget will use the supplied file as the HSTS database.
