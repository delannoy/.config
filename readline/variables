################################################################################

set bell-style visible
# Controls what happens when Readline wants to ring the terminal bell. If set to `none`, Readline never rings the bell. If set to `visible`, Readline uses a visible bell if one is available.

set colored-stats on
# If set to `on`, Readline displays possible completions using different colors to indicate their file type. The color definitions are taken from the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable.

set completion-ignore-case on
# If set to On, readline performs filename matching and completion in a case-insensitive fashion.

set completion-map-case on
# If set to On, and completion-ignore-case is enabled, readline treats hyphens (-) and underscores (_) as equivalent when performing case-insensitive filename matching and completion.

set completion-prefix-display-length 4
# The length in characters of the common prefix of a list of possible completions that is displayed without modification. When set to a value greater than zero, common prefixes longer than this value are replaced with an ellipsis when displaying possible completions.

set print-completions-horizontally on
# If set to On, readline will display completions with matches sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the screen.

set show-all-if-unmodified on
# If set to `on`, words which have more than one possible completion without any possible partial completion (the possible completions don`t share a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
