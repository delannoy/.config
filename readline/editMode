set editing-mode vi
# The editing-mode variable controls which default set of key bindings is used. By default, Readline starts up in Emacs editing mode, where the keystrokes are most similar to Emacs. This variable can be set to either `emacs` or `vi`.

set show-mode-in-prompt on
# If set to `on`, add a string to the beginning of the prompt indicating the editing mode: emacs, vi command, or vi insertion. The mode strings are user-settable (e.g., emacs-mode-string). The default value is `off`.

set emacs-mode-string "\1\e[3 q\e]12;orange\a\2"
# If the show-mode-in-prompt variable is enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when emacs editing mode is active. The value is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available. Use the `\1` and `\2` escapes to begin and end sequences of non-printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string. The default is `@`.

set vi-cmd-mode-string "\1\e[1 q\e]12;darkRed\a\2"
# If the show-mode-in-prompt variable is enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in command mode. The value is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available. Use the `\1` and `\2` escapes to begin and end sequences of non-printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string. The default is `(cmd)`.

set vi-ins-mode-string "\1\e[5 q\e]12;white\a\2"
# If the show-mode-in-prompt variable is enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in insertion mode. The value is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available. Use the `\1` and `\2` escapes to begin and end sequences of non-printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string. The default is `(ins)`.
