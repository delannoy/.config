[log]
    date = format:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M # [Set the default date-time mode for the log command. Setting a value for log.date is similar to using git log's --date option.](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-logdate)
    decorate = auto # [Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown by the log command. If short is specified, the ref name prefixes refs/heads/, refs/tags/ and refs/remotes/ will not be printed. If full is specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed. If auto is specified, then if the output is going to a terminal, the ref names are shown as if short were given, otherwise no ref names are shown.](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-logdecorate)
