[http]
    emptyAuth = true # [Attempt authentication without seeking a username or password. This can be used to attempt GSS-Negotiate authentication without specifying a username in the URL, as libcurl normally requires a username for authentication.](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-httpemptyAuth)

[push]
    default = simple # [Defines the action git push should take if no refspec is given (whether from the command-line, config, or elsewhere).](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-pushdefault)
    # simple - pushes the current branch with the same name on the remote.
    # If you are working on a centralized workflow (pushing to the same repository you pull from, which is typically origin), then you need to configure an upstream branch with the same name.
    # This mode is the default since Git 2.0, and is the safest option suited for beginners.

[submodule]
    recurse = true # [A boolean indicating if commands should enable the --recurse-submodules option by default. Applies to all commands that support this option (checkout, fetch, grep, pull, push, read-tree, reset, restore and switch) except clone and ls-files.](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-submodulerecurse)
