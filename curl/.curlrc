# [Config file](https://everything.curl.dev/cmdline/configfile#default-config-file)

# [When used in conjunction with the --output option, curl will create the necessary local directory hierarchy as needed. This option creates the directories mentioned with the --output option, nothing else. If the --output file name uses no directory, or if the directories it mentions already exist, no directories will be created.](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--create-dirs)
create-dirs

# [(TLS SFTP SCP) By default, every secure connection curl makes is verified to be secure before the transfer takes place. This option makes curl skip the verification step and proceed without checking.](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-k)
# insecure

# [(HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response code), this option will make curl redo the request on the new place.](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-L)
location

# [(HTTP) Set maximum number of redirections to follow. When --location is used, to prevent curl from following too many redirects, by default, the limit is set to 50 redirects. Set this option to -1 to make it unlimited.](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--max-redirs)
max-redirs 50

# [This option specifies the directory in which files should be stored, when --remote-name or --output are used. The given output directory is used for all URLs and output options on the command line, up until the first -:, --next. If the specified target directory does not exist, the operation will fail unless --create-dirs is also used.](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--output-dir)
# output-dir

# [Write output to <file> instead of stdout.](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-o)
# output

# [Make curl display transfer progress as a simple progress bar instead of the standard, more informational, meter. This progress bar draws a single line of '#' characters across the screen and shows a percentage if the transfer size is known. For transfers without a known size, there will be space ship (-=o=-) that moves back and forth but only while data is being transferred, with a set of flying hash sign symbols on top.](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--preproxy)
progress-bar

# [(HTTP) This option tells the --remote-name option to use the server-specified Content-Disposition filename instead of extracting a filename from the URL. If the server-provided file name contains a path, that will be stripped off before the file name is used. The file is saved in the current directory, or in the directory specified with --output-dir. If the server specifies a file name and a file with that name already exists in the destination directory, it will not be overwritten and an error will occur. If the server does not specify a file name then this option has no effect.](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-J)
# remote-header-name

# [Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get. (Only the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut off). The file will be saved in the current working directory. If you want the file saved in a different directory, make sure you change the current working directory before invoking curl with this option. The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the given URL, nothing else, and if it already exists it will be overwritten.](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-O)
# remote-name

# [When used with -s, --silent, it makes curl show an error message if it fails.](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-S)
# show-error

# [Silent or quiet mode. Do not show progress meter or error messages. Makes Curl mute. It will still output the data you ask for, potentially even to the terminal/stdout unless you redirect it. Use --show-error in addition to this option to disable progress meter but still show error messages.](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-s)
# silent

# [Prepends a time stamp to each trace or verbose line that curl displays.](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--trace-time)
# trace-time

# [(HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server. To encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single quote marks. This header can also be set with the --header or the --proxy-header options.](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-A)
# user-agent "${_USERAGENT}"

# [Make curl display information on stdout after a completed transfer. The format is a string that may contain plain text mixed with any number of variables. The format can be specified as a literal "string", or you can have curl read the format from a file with "@filename" and to tell curl to read the format from stdin you write "@-".](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-w)
# filename_effective    The ultimate filename that curl writes out to. This is only meaningful if curl is told to write to a file with the --remote-name or --output option. It's most useful in combination with the --remote-header-name option.
# size_download         The total amount of bytes that were downloaded. This is the size of the body/data that was transferred, excluding headers.
# time_total            The total time, in seconds, that the full operation lasted.
write-out = '%{filename_effective}:%{size_download}:%{time_total}'
